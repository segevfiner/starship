[Return to Presets](./README.md#powerline-only-symbols)

This preset restricts the use of symbols to those from emoji and powerline sets.

This means that even without a Nerd Font installed, you should be able to view
all module symbols.

This preset will become the default preset in a future release of starship.

### Configuration

```sh
starship preset powerline-only-symbols > ~/.config/starship.toml
```
